Crowd Monitoring Project

ShanghaiTech Dataset : 
	
=> The dataset was proposed in the paper “Single‑Image Crowd Counting via Multi‑Column Convolutional Neural Network” (Zhang et al., 2016). 
=> It contains roughly 1,198 images in total with about 330,000 annotated head locations.
=> It is split into Part A and Part B:
      <> Part A: 482 images, higher crowd density (crawled from internet) 
      <> Part B: 716 images, lower to moderate density (busy streets of Shanghai) 
   Further, each part is divided into training and testing subsets and each subset contain images and ground-truth folders.
      <> images/        
	- Contains the crowd scene pictures — real images with many people.
      <> ground-truth/  
	- Contains the annotations for each image.
	- Each .mat file (MATLAB file) contains the coordinates of each person’s head position.

=> The folder structure looks like :
	ShanghaiTech/
    	    |-Part_A/
        	|-train_data/
            	     |-images/
            	     |-ground_truth/
        	|-test_data/
            	     |-images/
            	     |-ground_truth/
            |-Part_B/
        	|-train_data/
            	     |-images/
            	     |-ground_truth/
        	|-test_data/
            	     |-images/
                     |-ground_truth/
